# VISION.md - Futures Screener (Binance Futures focus)\n\n## Overview\n- Scope: Binance Futures screener with three tabs: Densities, Mini-charts/Screener, Signals.\n- Current status: Backend groundwork exists for Densities; frontend not yet implemented.\n- Tabs are designed to align with Binance Futures data and workflows.\n\n## Tab 1: Densities (P densities)\n- Goal: Provide density-based prioritization for futures assets; backend prepared; frontend pending.\n- Key features:\n  - backend power for density computation (pre-aggregated densities available)\n  - API endpoints to fetch densities per asset\n  - placeholder UI for densities view (to be wired)\n- Status: Tab1 = backend ready, frontend not completed.\n\n## Tab 2: Mini-charts / Screener\n- Goal: Lightweight mini-charts + screener matrix similar to Digas/Taoscalp; prototype.\n- Key features:\n  - per-asset mini-chart rendering data structure\n  - tabular screener view with sortable columns (price, volume, change)\n  - data fetch hook to pull mini-chart data (to be wired)\n- Status: Tab2 = backend TBD, frontend pending.\n\n## Tab 3: Signals (RSI / zones / events)\n- Goal: Signal engine viewing RSI bands, zone highlighting, event signals.\n- Key features:\n  - RSI calculation hooks (server-side or client-side plan)\n  - zone mapping (overbought/oversold) visualization\n  - event-driven signals for alerts\n- Status: Tab3 = backend TBD, frontend pending.\n\n
