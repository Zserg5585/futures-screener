# MEMORY.md - Long-term memory for Futures Screener

This file serves as the long-term memory for the OpenClaw agent operating in /home/app/futures-screener. It captures significant decisions, lessons, milestones, and context that should persist across sessions.

## Guidelines
- Record decisions, outcomes, and rationale with dates when possible.
- Do not leak private data unless explicitly requested.
- Update as context evolves; prune outdated notes periodically.

## Structure suggestions
- memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md — daily notes for traceable context
- Sections to include:
  - Event / Decision
  - Why it mattered
  - Outcome / Next steps

## Current log (example)
- 2026-02-13: Bootstrapped identity Morty; defined core persona; created ROADMAP.md and STATUS.md. Next steps: populate USER.md, MEMORY.md, and START memory diaries.
